# WhatsOpt Documentation

## Getting started

To start with WhatsOpt, you need an account on a WhatOpt server (see [contact](#contact)).

Then we suggest to read the tutorial notebooks ([part 1](https://github.com/OneraHub/WhatsOpt-Doc/blob/master/whatsopt_tutorial_part_1.ipynb) and [part 2](https://github.com/OneraHub/WhatsOpt-Doc/blob/master/whatsopt_tutorial_part_2.ipynb)) and watch the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhWP4LJdKyGcFZyvsNLU4s2_sdmTSGVeo).

The [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333806928_WhatsOpt_a_web_application_for_multidisciplinary_design_analysis_and_optimization) will give you the overview and the background on the project.

## Developper documentation

For a deeper knowledge of the implementation of WhatsOpt, you can browse the [developer documentation](https://whatsopt.readthedocs.io).
WhatsOpt exposes some web services, you can access the [OpenAPI documentation](https://ether.onera.fr/whatsopt/api_doc).

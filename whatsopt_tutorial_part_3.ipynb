    "As we saw in previous parts, we are able to generate OpenMDAO source code from an analysis defined in WhatsOpt. We are going to see that we can do the other way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "With certain limitations explained below, we can create an analysis in WhatsOpt from an OpenMDAO source code, especially when the later one is originated from WhatsOpt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wop command allowing to so is <code>wop push <file.py></code>, where <file.py> is an Python file containing an OpenMDAO Problem setup. To experiment you can use the sellar code in examples directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd examples/sellar\n",
    "wop push sellar.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can observe that a new analysis is available in WhatsOpt _Analyses_ page list. This new analysis is a duplicate of the Sellar analysis we built manually in the Part 1 of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "A WhatsOpt main assumption is that variable names are visible globally (i.e. all variable are promoted). Indeed building process within WhatsOpt ensure that variable names are uniq. \n",
    "\n",
    "So OpenMDAO code that do not follow that principle may give wrong results when pushed. From the previous point, connections defined with <code>connect</code> are not supported.\n",
